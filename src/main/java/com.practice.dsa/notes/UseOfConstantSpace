To solve a problem with constant extra space, the key is to avoid using additional data structures such as arrays, lists, or hashmaps, and focus on modifying the input directly or using a few variables for storage. The space complexity is O(1), meaning the space used remains constant regardless of the input size.

Here are some typical strategies that can help solve problems with constant extra space:

1. In-place Modification
If the problem allows you to modify the input data structure, you can solve it by modifying the structure directly.
Example: Reversing an array in place or rotating an array using a constant number of variables.
2. Two Pointers or Multiple Indices
Many problems can be solved with two pointers or indices that traverse the input data structure.
Example: Merging two sorted arrays without using extra space by modifying one of the arrays directly.
3. Using Variables for Tracking
Instead of using an additional array or list, you can use a small number of variables (constant amount) to track the necessary information.
Example: Calculating the maximum subarray sum using a few variables for the current sum and maximum sum.
Example Problems Solved with Constant Extra Space
Reversing an Array:

If you need to reverse an array in place, you can use two pointers, one starting from the beginning and one from the end, and swap the elements.
python
Copy code
def reverse_array(arr):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
Removing Duplicates from a Sorted Array:

You can solve this in constant space by using the two-pointer technique to keep track of unique elements and adjust the array in place.
python
Copy code
def remove_duplicates(arr):
    if not arr:
        return 0
    # Pointer for the place to insert the next unique element
    j = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] != arr[j]:
            j += 1
            arr[j] = arr[i]
    return j + 1
Cycle Detection in a Linked List (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare):

This algorithm uses two pointers (fast and slow) to detect if there is a cycle in a linked list without any extra space.
python
Copy code
def has_cycle(head):
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False
Finding the Missing Number in an Array (1 to N):

You can find the missing number by calculating the expected sum and subtracting the actual sum without needing extra space.
python
Copy code
def find_missing_number(arr):
    n = len(arr) + 1
    total_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
    actual_sum = sum(arr)
    return total_sum - actual_sum
